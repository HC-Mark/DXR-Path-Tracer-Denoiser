### Overview:

This project is complete DXR pipeline that use 1 spp path tracing noisy image and Blockwise Multi-Order Feature Regression technique to produce high resolution physically-correct image. There are five stages in our pipeline:

1. A basic path tracer produces 1 spp output image and populates necessary feature buffers(normal and world position) based on the 1 spp image
2. Pre-process the current frame to mix up with previous frames’ data
3. Apply Blockwise Multi-Order Feature Regression on the feature buffers
4. Post-process the frames’ data by accumulating the current frame’s information in
5. Apply the computed color to the pixel

​	The base code of path tracer is based on a very good DXR tutorial:  http://cwyman.org/code/dxrTutors/dxr_tutors.md.html, which teaches people how to develop path tracer using a very powerful library Falcor( https://developer.nvidia.com/falcor )
